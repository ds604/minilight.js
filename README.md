JS port by Darius Bacon


### installation
This code depends on node.js and npm being installed. After you clone this project, run `npm install` to pull in the project's dependencies.

### building

The browser compatible javascript is bundled into `bundle.js` via browserify.
 
Invoking `npm run watch` will run continuously, looking for changes to any of the `.js` files, and rebuild the bundle automatically. You can then refresh your browser to see the updated changes.

      * all communication is serialised
      * pass frame data back like image saving
